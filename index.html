   <h1>Hailia Sommerville</h1>
  <h1>My favorite hobbies are crocheting and hiking. As much as I like technology, I love unplugging even more. 
  Nature is so beautiful and I enjoy connecting with it. I believe we should all "touch grass" from time
  to time. Crocheting also brings me joy. Being able to take yarn and a hook and create a project is so fulfilling. I appreciate
  all the articles of clothing I make so much more because of the time I put into turning string into something wearable. I look 
  forward to getting the same fulfilment from my coding projects over the course of this workshop and after.</h1>
